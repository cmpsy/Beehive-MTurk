The experiment uses JavaScript to display the shape arrangements.  If the <canvas> tag is supported, it is used to draw all of the shapes.  In older browsers where canvas is not supported, images stored on my personal athena space are used instead.  This is a much slower method.

The experiment has been tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox on a Mac, and Internet Explorer 8 on emulated Windows 7.  It probably doesn't work at all on Internet Explorer 6, but I haven't tried.  Nothing ever works on IE6 without a lot of work.

To run the experiment, make a new HIT template in MTurk and copy the HTML source in "beehive-mturk.html".  Create an input csv from multiple experiment files by running "python parse.py [file1.txt] [file2.txt] â€¦ [output_file.csv]".  This puts together the experiment files "file1.txt", "file2.txt", and so on into one csv file that can be uploaded to MTurk to make several HITs at once.

The experiment files each holds multiple trials, in a similar format to the old desktop version.  You can do comments with lines starting with "#"; otherwise the javascript isn't forgiving of extra lines and such.  Everything is tab delimited.
Format:
[Trial name]	[Number of rows]	[Number of shapes]	[Number of frames]	[Pre-emptive answering allowed? (yes/no)]
[Question 1]
[Question 2] (leave blank if no question 2, don't skip the line)
[Shape (c,s,t,q)]	[Color (r,g,b,y,w)]	[Radius in px]	[Frame number]	[(Optional) Position]
.
.
.

Frame number starts at 1. Position is an optional value: if left blank, the usual position order is used.  Otherwise, it can be an ordered pair (column, row), or a number based on the usual position numbering.

Multiple trials can be put into one file, not separated by any lines.  The trials will be presented in order to the user.  Let me know if you want me to permute the trials.
